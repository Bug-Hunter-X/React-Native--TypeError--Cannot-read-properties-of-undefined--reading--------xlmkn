This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This can happen when working with asynchronous data, such as fetching data from an API. When the data is still loading, you might try to access properties before the data has been fetched. This leads to a runtime error because you are attempting to access a property of a null or undefined object, which is not allowed.
