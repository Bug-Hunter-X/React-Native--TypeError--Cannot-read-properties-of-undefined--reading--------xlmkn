# React Native: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. The error message usually looks like this: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')`.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to render data from an API before the data is fully fetched. This causes the `TypeError` because the component tries to access properties of `data` before it's populated.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to fix the error by using optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators. These operators provide safe ways to access properties of potentially undefined objects without throwing errors.
